Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you astray? Shut it, Hoodie! Jo, look. That's Skaro. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. Let's go in! Oh my word! It seems you have a very large rat Brigadier—maybe you should employ the services of a very large cat? Physician, heal thyself. Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us.

So these are my replacements. A dandy and a clown. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought. Rest is for the weary, sleep is for the dead. I feel like a hungry man eager for the feast! You know how it is; you put things off for a day and next thing you know, it's a hundred years later.

What? What?! WHAT?! I think it's time to find your Achilles heel, or should I say - flipper. When I say run, run. ...RUN! Well Kangs, I must say, there's no place like home... and this is no place like home. Bow ties are cool. Goodbye... Fancypants! I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! Don't worry, Brigadier. People will be shooting at you soon. You were expecting someone else? I've reversed the polarity of the Neutron flow, so the TARDIS should be free from the force field now.

Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. You’ll never understand. I want to see the universe, not to rule it. You may disguise your features but you can never disguise your intent. I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part. Come on! Allow me to congratulate you, sir. You have the most totally closed mind that I've ever encountered.

A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting. I'm Scottish. I can complain about things now. I can really complain about things now. An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. Ricky, if I was to tell you what I was doing to the controls of my frankly magnificent timeship, would you even begin to understand? One day, just one day, maybe I'll meet somebody who gets the whole 'don't wander off' thing. Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast.

Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? There's always something to look at if you open your eyes! Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about? Geronimo! Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. Mmmmm…. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for 'minimalism', but I think I came up with 'magician'. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.

Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old. Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm, don't like it. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! Life depends on change and renewal.

That's the trouble with regeneration. You quite never know what you're going to get. Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. Now would you stand aside before I shoot myself? Smith. Doctor John Smith. It may be irrational of me, but human beings are my favorite species. Not allowed? Not allowed? Me, I’m allowed everywhere. The thing is, Adam, time travel is like visiting Paris. You can't just read the guidebook, you've got to throw yourself in! Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers! Or is that just me?

New-new-Doctor. Renewed? Have I? That's it, I've been renewed. It's part of the TARDIS. Without it I couldn't survive. My last incarnation…oh, I was never happy with that one. It had a sort of feckless 'charm' which simply wasn't me. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.

Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow. But there are three rules! One: I'm in charge. Two: I'm not 'the Professor', I'm the Doctor! And the third... Well, I'll think up the third by the time we get back to Perivale. Bow ties are cool. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments not water pistols!

I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Allons-y! Sorry, must dash! Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those. No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them. Well, I'll tell you something that should be of vital interest to you.…That you, Sir, are a NITWIT! Well, who are you boys? Oh, of course! Are you his companions? Butterfingers. An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old. Timing malfunction. The Master! He's out there. I've got to stop... him...

Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. I've made many mistakes... and it's about time that I did something about that. Excellent. Blow up that vehicle. Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. Life depends on change and renewal.
